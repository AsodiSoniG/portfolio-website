        <h1>A Creative Launch into My Developer Journey</h1>
        <p><strong>Tech Used: </strong>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript</p>
        <p>This project marks the very first milestone in my journey as a front-end developer.<br>It's a personal
          portfolio website that I built entirely from scratch using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any
          frameworks or libraries. At the time, I was still learning and experimenting, yet I poured all my creativity
          and effort into crafting something meaningful.<br>The portfolio features smooth hover effects,
          scroll-triggered animations, and a responsive layout that adapts across devices. I also included an
          interactive footer section with a ‚ÄúDownload Resume‚Äù button and a ‚ÄúVisit GitHub‚Äù link, making the portfolio not
          just a static site, but a functional gateway to my professional presence. What makes this project special is
          that every element from the structure to the styling was hand-coded while learning in real-time. It reflects
          not only my technical understanding at that stage, but also my passion to build something presentable and
          purposeful, even as a beginner.This project will always hold a special place for me, as it represents the
          foundation I've built upon ‚Äî where curiosity met consistency, and where my love for web development truly
          began.</p>

        <h1>Modern Login Form Sleek, Responsive & Dark-Themed UI
        </h1>
        <p><strong>Tech Used: </strong>HTML5, CSS3</p>
        <p>This project is a fully responsive, modern login form that I designed during my early stages of learning
          front-end development. Built with just HTML and CSS, this design reflects my growing love for clean UI and
          minimal aesthetics. Featuring a glassy, transparent background layered over a dark-themed layout, the form
          gives a futuristic and immersive feel.The entire layout is centered with soft shadows, subtle transitions, and
          an intuitive user experience. I included a cleanly styled login button and used smart spacing and alignment to
          maintain both functionality and elegance. The form adjusts beautifully across screen sizes, making it both
          user-friendly and visually striking.
          Among all my practice designs, this remains one of my personal favorites a confident experiment with dark UI,
          glassmorphism, and shadow dynamics at a time when I was still building my foundation in web design.

        <h1>Note Keeper App - My Upskilling Journey</h1>
        <p><strong>Tech Used: </strong>HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, React, Node.js, Json</p>
        <p>This project truly represents a turning point in my web development journey a functional Note Keeper App that
          pushed me to explore and implement advanced front-end and back-end technologies. Built using HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript (ES6), React, Node.js, and even Vue, this application helped me bridge the gap between basic UI
          building and dynamic, data-driven interfaces.The app allows users to seamlessly add, render, and delete notes,
          offering a smooth and intuitive experience. From managing. component state in React to handling data flow,
          conditional rendering, and DOM manipulation ‚Äî every step of building this project. taught me valuable
          problem-solving skills. I even experimented with different design patterns and logic approaches across.
          frameworks to understand what fits bes. More than just a project, this was a personal breakthrough. It
          challenged me, excited me, and ultimately helped me unlock a new. level of confidence as a developer. I walked
          into it as a learner and came out truly upskilled and that's exactly what makes. this app one of my proudest
          creations to date.
